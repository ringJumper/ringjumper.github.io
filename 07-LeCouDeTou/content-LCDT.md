### Location

Easy to find, hard to leave.

10° 28' 32" N
119° 14' 50" E

Our place is behind the basketball court/Barangay Hall. Despite the fact that Port Barton belongs to the municipality of San Vicente it is good to have in mind that the distance between them is 35 km on a very bad road or 85km on a better road.

By Van - Air-conditioned vans run by two companies: Recaro and Nature Living and they run from Puerto Princesa-Barton vv. and El Nido-Barton vv. It takes approximately 3-4 hours from either place.

Price: Php500

By Bus - Port Barton can also be reached by bus which do not run as often as the vans. They are not always air-conditioned and may take a bit longer but are cheaper than vans.

Price: Php200

By Boat - Port Barton can also be accessed by boat from different locations but that has to be booked as a private arrangement.

### About the Host

Our place is a in the middle of the small village of Port Barton and we are accredited by the Department of Tourism. The beach is within walking distance, approx 250m. We are focus on giving you a genuine filipino hospitality and with a warm welcoming atmosphere. The people here in Port Barton love to stage large fiestas and other festivals and it can be rather noisy all over the village when these parties are on.
We are a Swedish/ Filipino couple that have been looking for a place to set up a guesthouse. We enjoy traveling as well as running hotel/ restaurant businesses. The opportunity came some years ago when we found a piece of land in Port Barton, a small and calm village that fit perfectly for what we wanted.
Port Barton is a barangay within the San Vicente Municipality on the island of Palawan in the southwest of the Philippines with a population of approximately 5000 people with tourism, fishing, and forestry as their main source of income. It can be reached from Puerto Princesa by a road going north, approximately 150 km (92 miles). The last 20 km to Port Barton is partly concrete and partly gravel and can be pretty rough during rainy season.
